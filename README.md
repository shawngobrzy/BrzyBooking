# BrzyBooking
This is a simulation of a hotel booking app in AndroidStudio that will provide the user with three readily available hotels to choose from that
all provide a brief description about the price, features, location,and other factors that are relevant to a customer when considering a place
to stay temporarily. After choosing a hotel, the customer will be directed to another page with more details regarding how long they want to stay,
how many rooms they will have, and contact details just in case there is a question, comment, or concern that requires authoritative assistance.
